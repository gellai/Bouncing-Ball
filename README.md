# Bouncing Ball

## What is this?
It is a very simple game written in C where a 'O' character (ball) is bouncing around in the terminal console. On the bottom there is a pad which can be horizontally moved with the LEFT and RIGHT arrows on the keyboard. The target is to catch the ball with the pad so the ball can bounce back from it. If it is a miss, the game restarts. By adjusting the height of the console, the difficulty of the game is changing. 

## Supported systems
Written and tested on Linux Mint. 'ncurses' library is required.
